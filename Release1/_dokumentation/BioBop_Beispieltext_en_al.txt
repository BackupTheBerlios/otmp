Bio-BOP - is a product typical for ethical trading with developing countries

Bio-cultivating food  is far more labour intense than ordinary types of 
cultivation and thus results in additional employment opportunities. Tee 
gardens and tee processing facilities are owned by families. Workers not 
only receive above average pay but have access to free medical 
treatment. Furthermore workers pay a mere 20% of accomodation fees and 
their children receive a free education.
This tee is cultivated in the Sri-Lankan tee region UVA at an altitude 
of 1200-1500m. The crop "High brewed with vegetation propergard" is 
resistant to plant deseases. This tee is of excellent quality. In 
addition slower, natural growth due to bio-cultivation makes the tee 
more aromatic.
